This repo cover simulate scheduling algorithms like FCFS, SJF, priority SJF

:large_orange_diamond: FCFS First in, first out (FIFO), also known as first come, first served (FCFS), is the simplest scheduling algorithm. FIFO simply queues processes in the order that they arrive in the ready queue.
In this, the process that comes first will be executed first and next process starts only after the previous gets fully executed.

:large_orange_diamond: SJF Shortest Job First (SJF) is an algorithm in which the process having the smallest execution time is chosen for the next execution. This scheduling method can be preemptive or non-preemptive. It significantly reduces the average waiting time for other processes awaiting execution. The full form of SJF is Shortest Job First.

:large_orange_diamond: priority SJF Priority Scheduling is a method of scheduling processes that is based on priority. In this algorithm, the scheduler selects the tasks to work as per the priority.
